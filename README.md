homework 1 - simulate exponential distribution inter arrival time

- plot cdf for arrival F(t)
- plot P<sub>n</sub>(t), n equals to the arrival number
<br>

- note: P<sub>n</sub>(t) is the probability that n arrivals arrive during t-1 to t.
- Figures are plotted with Matlab by using the text files (simulation results) auto-generated along exponential_distribution.c.
